OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library which is often found in researches and commercial products. Its robustness and ease of use contribute to its popularity for being choosen in general applications involving image processing. As of Python, it is scripting programming language with human-readable syntax. Python have many libraries in its repository which make it even easier to use. If both OpenCV and Python are easy to use, shouldn't image processing will be easy as well? Yes it should be! The topics in this part are arranged as below:
* [01. Images]
* [02. Histogram]
* [03. Binary Vision]
* [04. Geometric Transformation]
* [05. Edges]
