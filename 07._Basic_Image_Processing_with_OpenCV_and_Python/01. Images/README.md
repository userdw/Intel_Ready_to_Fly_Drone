# [ENGLISH] 01. Images

<img src="/images/Lenna.jpg" height="400">

In this practice, we will use well known image of Lenna above for testing purpose. You will need to copy the image in your project folder. Connect HDMI monitor to your Intel® Aero Platform for UAVs then boot it up. After the terminal opened, type:

```
python3
```

The command will brings up Python 3 interpreter. To check whether OpenCV is installed or not, type:

```python
import cv2
cv2.__version__
```

The last command should tell you the version of OpenCV.

Since we don't have a friendly text editor in Intel® Aero Platform for UAVs, we could make use of [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php). We can type our code on Windows based desktop/laptop then transfer the code to Intel® Aero Platform for UAVs. [add more step, making folder ]
